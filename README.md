## About
---------
Humble Numble is a numbers version of the Wordle game, deliberately kept simple (Humble).   This site offers a fun way to practice mathematical equations, using an interface that many are already familiar with.
Many people worldwide take part in the 'Wordle' game, which offers a chance to guess a 5-letter english-language word in 6 tries.  With Wordle, the user is presented with a grid and must choose from a panel showing the letters of the alphabet (26 possible characters), to form a dictionary-recognised english word (ie it is logically consistent).  On pressing ENTER, the user's guess is validated, and each letter of their grid entry is colour coded as 
* grey - this guessed letter doesnt exist within the solution; 
* orange - the guessed letter exists in the solution, but not at the guessed position;
* green - the guessed letter exists in the solution, and was guessed at the correct position.
<br>
The panel of letters is also updated with the appropriate colour (grey, orange, green) for the chosen letter.
(Note that sometimes a word will have a double letter in which case a second guess including this letter will result in a further orange/green for the letter - in this case, on the panel it shows green).

So.... Humble Numble is a version of Wordle applied to numbers.  The panel represents an equation, there is a six-row grid to make guesses, and the user must choose from numbers 1..20 and simple operators +-*/ to arrive at a given target number.  The 'solution' is a predefined equation, e.g. <br>
13+5+6=24 <br>
5+3-6=2 <br>
<br>_
i.e. the format is <num1> <op1> <num2> <op2> <num3> = target <br>
    

Any guessed expression must be 'logically consistent' ie should evaluate to the target number.  (an error message 'wrong calc' will pop up if an inconsistent equation is entered)
Evaluation uses PEMDAS priorities - well actually MDAS -: Multiply Divide Add Subtract, therefore <br>
13+6/3 is evaluated as 13+(6/3), equating to 13+2 evaluating to 15. <br>
20+12*6 is evaluated as 20+(12*6)=20+ 72=92 <br>
12*6+20 is evaluated as (12*6)+20 = 72+20 = 92 <br>
5-2*2 = 5-4 = 1
2*2-2 = 4-2 = 2
2*2/2 = 4/2 = 2

If an equation contained multiply and divide, the sequence will affect the result, ie :
6* 10 / 5 = (6 *10) / 5 = 60 / 5 = 12 
10 / 5 * 6 is calculated as 10/(5*6) so 10/30 or 0.3333


<ul> Rules:  
    <li> All target results will be integers, ie no decimals or fractions.   This makes it a little easier to guess. </li>
    <li> Each equation contains 3 numbers (operands) and 2 operators and must calculate to the target number.  A guess which doesn't calculate correctly will be accepted at Humble Numble V1.0 (the user may wish to strategically test out some number or oeprator combinations, while knowing that they will not solve the equation on this guess.  </li>
(refer to 'How To Play' for a full set of rules - https://deemccart.github.io/CI_PP2_HumbleNumble/)

## Project Goals
----------------
1. To produce a 6-try numbers-based game. 
2. Using a mobile-friendly development development approach.  
3. Which uses the capabilities of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
4. And is possible to play with a reasonable chance of success.
  
### UX Design Strategy
Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a game which began as a personal project for software engineer Josh Wardle.   As of Jan 2022 it had 2M weekend players (theguardian.com 'Wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-his-puzzle') and was subsequently acquired by the New York Times.  The Guardian wrote that 'Wordleâ€™s popularity is thought to be partly because, in an era of apps aggressively competing for your attention and time, the game was deliberately built to be played once a day, and without features designed to promote its growth such as push notifications and email sign ups.'  Current estimates are of 250K daily users, many of whom are repeat users, and 57% of whom play the game on their smartphone (blog.gitnux.com).

Humble Numble aims to piggyback on the Wordle philosophies of:
* simple interface with uncluttered screen
* clearly understood rules
* scarcity - user can only access one game per day
* reponsiveness - ability to play on small screens (convenient for user)
* no time-out - can fit into small pockets of time as game will remain on-screen until 6 guesses completed
* feedback and interaction - user immediately gets feedback for each guess
* statistic tracking - user can track # of attempts to solve, number of days solved, success rates
* peer-group communication - user can share their problem-solving pattern (without revealing any part of the solution) to friends who may also play

### UX Design Strategy Analysis - Existing Numble Games

<details><summary>Analysis of Existing Numble Websites</summary>
Using Google search, the following were identified as possible Numble websites -
https://thenumble.app/ <br>
https://numble.wtf <br>
https://numble.game <br>
https://numble.win<br>
https://numble.online<br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numble (wikipedia)<br>

Whilst these sites individually contain some good features, none offers the range of functionality, and simplicity of design, available from the Wordle site.   

<img src="https://deemccart.github.io/CI_PP2_HumbleNumble/docs/readme_images/strategy_competitive_analysis.jpg">

### UX Design Strategy Target Audience
The aim of this specific website is develop a Numble game which can be played in simple form

The target audience is:<br>
a. People who enjoy puzzle-solving<br>
b. People who already play Wordle and are familiar with the user interface (e.g. grey, orange, green guess-letter evaluation; 6 tries,  grid layout)<br>
c. People who want to have a reliable consistent experience through out the game (in other words, they want an opportunity to finish the game by reaching the end, and they want to be able to trust the process (ie they can understand how they move forward or backwards, and they dont feel it is unfair or impossible to complete).<br>
d. People who like to practice their mathametical skills<br>

* Game players
* who enjoy mathematical puzzles
* and want to have a bit of fun doing it

## UX Design Scope
----------------

### UX Design Scope User Requirements and Expectations
/</details> 
<br>
From the analysis of existing games, a set of possible requirements was identified for a new portal.
<br><br>
The basic requirement for users is to have access to a 'fair' game where they have a possibility of reaching the goal.
* The game is a fun way of applying simple mathematical principles
    
<ul>MVP Requirements:
<li>Must be intuitive to use</li>
<li>Must be easy to learn</li>
<li>Good for first time or returning users</li>
<li>Accessible - no ad display & no paywall</li>
<li>Familiar interface for Wordle consumers</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>Requirements - Desirable:
<li>Would like to share results (graphic showing the pattern of result)</li>
<li>Would like to be able to track user statistics (cookies)</li>
<li>Would like to be able to auto-generate new equations</li>
<li>Would like to be able to track equations already used</li>
<li>Would like to be able to set difficulty levels</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>To incorporate as many of the Wordle characteristics below as possible:
<li>Simple interface with uncluttered screen</li>
<li>clearly understood rules</li>
<li>scarcity - user can only access one game per day</li>
<li>reponsiveness - ability to play on small screens (convenient for user)</li>
<li>no time-out - can fit into small pockets of time as game will remain on-screen until 6 guesses completed</li>
<li>feedback and interaction - user immediately gets feedback for each guess</li>
<li>statistic tracking - user can track # of attempts to solve, number of days solved, success rates</li>
<li>peer-group communication - user can share their problem-solving pattern (without revealing any part of the solution) to friends who may also play</li>
</ul>

### UX Design Scope - Data
A set of equations are pre-loaded which are consistent with game rules (e.g. operator numbers not > 20, calculations return an integer value)
Currently Humble Numble will randomly select one of these equations for each game.

### Fonts Chosen
The fonts are deliberately chosen to mimic appearance of Wordle screen. 
In real life, Wordle uses proprietary fonts (NYT Karnak Condensed), with Helventica Sans for the grid and button text.  A reasonably close match, which is widely available on a range of devices, was thought to be the Google bebas Neue font.

However, when testing the site this didnt present a good look, and so Robo Sans something or other was chosen as a better alternative.
Fallback fronts are used in both cases

### Colour Scheme 
The colour combinations mimic Wordle's game (for consistency and to ease the user learning experience).
   
The choice of colours for Humble Numble is very much in accordance with user story XX - consistent with Wordle so as to speed the learning process and encourage the focus on the game content, rather than on how to use it.

![Colours - dark mode normal contrast](./docs/readme_images/ux-design-choices-accessing-style-in-google-maps.jpg?raw=true "Humble Numble dark mode normal contrast")
![Colours - dark mode high contrast](./docs/readme_images/ux-design-choices-accessing-style-in-google-maps.jpg?raw=true "Humble Numble dark mode high contrast")


### Design Images
This site has very few images as the focus is on the game content.
A 'Wordle-type' logo is used on the Intro page.

### Design Images - Icons and Symbols

Certain icons and symbols used for quicklinks e.g. ? for About page, graphy symbol for Stats page, cog symbol for settings page. 


## Features 
 
### F01 Intro Screen
![Introduction page](./docs/readme_images/f01_intro.jpg?raw=true "Introduction page seen on first opening the website")
<br>
On first using the game (or on use within incognito mode) the user will encounter an introduction window, they can take a button to 'Play' or 'How to Play' to view help text.  The intro page shows the current date, the Humble Numble day number, and some copyright and acknowledgement notices.
    
### F02 Help Screen
![Humble Numble game explanation](./docs/readme_images/f02_help.jpg?raw=true "Scrollable text to show user instructions on how to play Humble Numble game")
<br>
A modal 'How to Play' explains how to play and some of the subtleties of the calculations.  Available from the 'how to play' button ![How to Play button](./docs/readme_images/f02_help.jpg?raw=true "Image of how-to-play button") on the Intro screen, or from the navbar help icon on all screens.   The 'How to Play' window can be scrolled to see full text, and is closed by clicking on the X in top right hand corner, at which point it disappears from screen.<br>
    ![help icon](./docs/readme_images/f02_help_icon.jpg?raw=true "Scrollable text to show user instructions on how to play Humble Numble game")
      
### F03 Play button
The Play button ![Play button](./docs/readme_images/f03_play_button.jpg?raw=true "Image of Play button")allows the user to go directly to a game screen, and immediately play a game ('call to action').

### F04 Randomly selected solution
An array of solutions is maintained, and an entry is randomly chosen from this array.  At the time of development this array contained approx 20 entries, which is sufficient for demo purposes, it is envisioned that this will be extended in the future.
![Array of possible solutions](./docs/readme_images/f04_solution_array.jpg?raw=true "Examples of possible solutions from which a random game choice is made")

### F05 Uncluttered game screen
The game screen is presented to the user fully initialised (ie a target value has been set and populated to each grid row).  The screen is free of ads and supplemental displays, which allows the user to focus on the game.
![Image of starting game screen](./docs/readme_images/f05_uncluttered_game_screen.jpg?raw=true "Starting game screen, clear and uncluttered, with target value and attempt number displaying")

### F06 Consistent Navbar
The Navbar is consistent throughout the website, 404 and feedback pages.  (modals/pop-ups are used to show intro and help pages, which don't show the navbar but when they are closed, the navbr can be seen on the underlying page)  Contains icons for Help, Stats and Settings.
![Navbar](./docs/readme_images/f06_navbar.jpg?raw=true "Navbar image")

### F07 Game grid
Interactive and responsive game grid which allows the user to record one set of guess tiles per attempt (the current attempt # is shown at top of screen).  The game grid is initially blank, and will be populated with successive user guesses.
Interactivity/feedback:  when the user presses ENTER to submit a guess, the guessed tiles update as green(correct); orange(present) or grey(absent).
![Game grid in progress](./docs/readme_images/f07_game_grid_in_progress.jpg?raw=true "game grid - in-progress game")

### F08 Keyboard display
A pseudo-keyboard shows the permitted entries.  The user must click on the keys using a mouse pointer to select an entry.  When a keyboard key is pressed, its colour flickers to light blue, and the key value is loaded to the current guess row on the game grid.  So the keyboard is the main user control for the game, and each press of a keyboard key triggers an action.   (keys 1-20, */-+ populate the game grid)).
![Keyboard display](./docs/readme_images/f08_keyboard_grid.jpg?raw=true "Image of keyboard display")
When the user presses ENTER to submit a guess, the keyboard elements used within the guess also update as green(correct); orange(present) or grey(absent).

### F09 DEL key
A backspace key is provided which allows the user to remove the last keyed entry on the current grid row.

### F10 ENTER key
The ENTER key submits the current guess row for validation. 

### F11 Equestion validation
When a guess is submitted, the equation which the user has submitted is parsed and validated as follows - the entries at the second and fourth columns are assessed to ensure these contain an operator (plus minus multiply divide); the guessed equation is then validated to check if it equates to the target value.  If not, an error message is shown, however the game (at this version) will still progress to individual element valuation.
![If equation has wrong total](./assets/readme_images/F11_wrong_total.jpg?raw=true "Equation calculates to incorrect total")

### F12  Individual guess element validation
Each element of the guess is compared to the solution, and its tile colour amended according to whether the guessed tile is:
* correct (green)- tile value is at this position in the solution;
* present (orange)- tile value is at a different position in the solution;
* absent (grey) - tile value is not in the solution.
![Feedback on game panel re guessed solution](./docs/readme_images/f12_game_interaction_feeback.jpg?raw=true "Image of guessed tiles changing colour")

The corresponding keyboard grid value is coloured on the lower part of the screen, e.g. '5' guessed correct; will colour both the row tile and the keyboard key green.  A (hidden) count of the number of correct elements is maintained.

### F18 About page (popup)

### F19 pre-defined data
Data created for the Humble Numble website with Google MyMaps included:
* pre-defined equations to be presented (possibly in random order)

### Features in Scope - refer to excel sheet for details of user stories (requirements) features and RTM.
This website includes X pages and Y features 
Features are as listed in previous section.
The pages - which effectively bring these features together - are:
* Landing Page (image link)
* Settings page (image link)
* About page (image link)
* Signup page
- __Home Page Intro Screen__

- __Main Game Screen__
The initial website page shows a 6 row x 7 column grid, where the user can enter their guesses, one per row, in the 5 left most columns.
The 6th column always contains the '=' sign
and the 7th column contains the target figure.

Towards the bottom of the screen a selection panel is shown, this shows 3 rows of possible entries with up to 10 characters in each
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
ENTER       +  -  *  /   <-BKSP

Clicking on a selection panel button will place the corresponding character in the next available space within the current grid row.
Clicking on ENTER will submit the current grid row as an entry.

- __Settings Page__
Ability to choose settings - to be decided

![Walks Page](./docs/readme_images/P02-Walk_Details.jpg?raw=true "Page with details for each walk")
 Choose difficulty level
The user can choose difficulty level EASY (all numbers <= 10) or DIFFICULT (numbers <=20 included)
Description
![Feature description](./docs/readme_images/230418%20Landing%20Page.jpg?raw=true "FeatureDesc")

- __Contact/Feedback page__ 
Signup for daily game playing reminder.

![Contact Page](./docs/readme_images/P04-Feedback.jpg?raw=true "Feedback")


- __404 Error Page__ 
This allows graceful failure, where the header and footer are preserved, allowing the user to navigate away from an error page using the site navigation (rather than the back button).
![Contact Page](./docs/readme_images/P04-Feedback.jpg?raw=true "Feedback")

### Implementation Decisions
Pre-defined calculations are stored in a multi-dimensional array as follows:
Solution [
[ 3, *,_ 7 * 2, 41_], // ie 3 * 7 * 2 = 41
[2, + , 5 * 7, 41] //ie 2 + 5 * 7 = (7) * 7 = 41
]
Each day's equation can therefore be referenced as Solution[day#]
Each days' elements can be referenced as solution[day#, element#]
This is useful when comparing a user entry for a match.

Daily user entries are stored in an array of 7 x 6 rows as follows:
Attempt [(undef, green, orange), (undef/green/orange), (undef/green/orange), (underf/green/orange), (undef/green/orange), (success)]
Attempt [attempt#, element#} can be compared to each of the entries in solution [day#, element#y] to search for a match - if found then if attempt.element# matches solution.element# then green, else orange.

Break out of loop when success, or when 6 tries reached.



### Features Left to Implement
Cookies to store user data from last attempts
                                                                                        
Choose difficulty level
The user can choose difficulty level EASY (all numbers <= 10) or DIFFICULT (numbers <=20 included)

Ability to choose 'Test' or 'Daily' mode
One of the beautiful features of wordle is its limited-release mode whereby only one puzzle is released daily ... this creates a sense of anticipation and the user wants more, they don't get the chance to become bored or tired with the game.  Similarly the proposed Humble Numble game is best delivered in Daily mode.  For the purpose of site demonstration, the user is currently permitted to enter Test mode (chosen from the settings page)

Provide proofs of successful testing of each user story### Unfixed Bugs
To be completed... mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 


## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab - pages 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
